## Project Overview

This repository combines **chemistry** and **computer science** to create interactive tools and simulations for learning chemical concepts. By leveraging Python and algorithms, we aim to make complex chemistry topics more accessible and engaging. The project includes:

- **Atomic Models**: Visualizations of atomic structures (e.g., Thomson, Rutherford, Bohr, and Quantum Mechanical models).
- **Molecular Dynamics**: Simulations of molecular interactions and behaviors.
- **Chemical Reactions**: Algorithms to balance equations and predict reaction outcomes.
- **Data Analysis**: Tools for analyzing chemical data and trends.

---

## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Use Python libraries like `matplotlib` and `plotly` to visualize atomic and molecular structures.
- **Algorithmic Simulations**: Implement algorithms to simulate chemical processes, such as electron behavior or reaction kinetics.
- **Educational Tools**: Step-by-step explanations and examples to help users understand the underlying chemistry and algorithms.
- **Modular Code**: Well-structured Python code that is easy to extend and adapt for new use cases.
